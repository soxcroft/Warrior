This project implements the necessary classes to simulate the game as desribed in the project specification. Game_23688963.java is the main class which should be run to see the output of this program. 

To run the program, first compile Game_23688963 by entering in the terminal: javac Game_23688963.java -d ../bin
Then, change directory to bin, and enter: java Game_23688963 <path of text file> <mode>
A mode of 0 should be used for plain output, and 1 for colored output. 

This project makes use of some of the programs in Princeton's Introduction to Programming in Java's standard library. The library can be found at: https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

The samples and project instructions were provided by Stellenbosch University.
